Kartsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication method for very large numbers.

In this project, Karatsuba Algorithm is implemented to calculate factorial of numbers. 

Normal program for factorial can do factorial upto 21, after that values overflow.

But, By this program, we can calculate factorial of 10000 which will produce very large number.
